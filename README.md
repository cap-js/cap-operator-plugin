# CAP Operator Plugin

CAP Operator Plugin provides an easy way to generate [CAP Operator](https://sap.github.io/cap-operator/) resources to deploy multitenant CAP Applications.

## Setup

To integrate the CAP Operator Plugin into your project, follow these steps:

1. Add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:

```sh
 npm add @cap-js/cap-operator-plugin -D
```

2. After installation, execute one of the following commands based on your requirements:

* To add a basic chart folder, use:
```sh
 cds add cap-operator
```
> During `cds build`, the plugin will automatically inject the templates folder into the final chart.

* To add a chart folder with templates included, use:
```sh
 cds add cap-operator --add-with-templates
```
> During `cds build`, the plugin will copy the templates folder into the final chart.

* **[Experimental]** To add a chart folder with the values.yaml prefilled with the design-time deployment details from the mta and mta extensions, use:
```sh
 cds add cap-operator --add-with-mta <mta-yaml-file-path> --add-with-mta-extensions <mta-ext-yaml-file-path>
```
> If you have multiple mta extensions, you can pass them as a comma-separated string in the order that they should be merged.

3. Once executed, the chart folder or chart folder with templates will be added to your project directory.

4. Update the `values.yaml` file with your design-time deployment details according to `values.schema.json`. You can either use any YAML schema validation extension or run the following command to ensure correctness:
```sh
helm lint <chart-path>
```

5. After filling all the design-time information in `values.yaml`, run `cds build`. The final chart will be generated in the `gen` folder within your project directory.

> Note: If you are adding the basic chart folder using the `cds add cap-operator` command, do not modify the `values.schema.json` file. The templates injected automatically during `cds build` are tightly coupled with the structure in `values.schema.json`. If schema changes are needed, use option `--add-with-templates` to add the templates folder and adjust them accordingly.
