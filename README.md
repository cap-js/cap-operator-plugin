# CAP Operator Plugin

CAP Operator Plugin provides an easy way to generate [CAP Operator](https://sap.github.io/cap-operator/) resources to deploy multitenant CAP Applications.

## Requirements

The CAP Operator plugin requires `@sap/cds-dk: ">=7.8.1"`. If @sap/cds-dk is installed globally, please ensure that the installed version is greater than or equal to `7.8.1`.

## Setup

To integrate the CAP Operator Plugin into your project, follow these steps:

1. Add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:

```sh
 npm add @cap-js/cap-operator-plugin -D
```

2. After installation, execute one of the following commands based on your requirements:

    * To add a basic chart folder, use:
        ```sh
        cds add cap-operator
        ```
        > During `cds build`, the plugin will automatically inject the templates folder into the final chart.

    * To add a chart folder with templates included, use:
        ```sh
        cds add cap-operator --with-templates
        ```
        > During `cds build`, the plugin will copy the templates folder into the final chart.

    > ### ⚠️ Experimental
    > To add a chart folder with the values.yaml prefilled with the design-time deployment details from the mta and mta extensions, use:
    >```sh
    > cds add cap-operator --with-mta <mta-yaml-file-path> --with-mta-extensions <mta-ext-yaml-file-path>
    >```
    > If you have multiple mta extensions, you can pass them as a comma-separated string in order to merge them.

2. Once executed, the chart folder or chart folder with templates will be added to your project directory.

3. The `values.yaml` requires two type of details:

    * Design-time deployment details
        - serviceInstances
        - serviceBindings
        - workloads
        - tenantOperations
        - contentJobs
    * Runtime deployment details
        - app
        - btp
        - imagePullSecrets
        - env information inside each workload like database instance ID

    As a developer, you need to fill in the design-time deployment details in the `values.yaml` file, which can then be pushed to your repository. The plugin will auto-populate some of these details based on the project configuration, but it's essential to verify them and manually fill in any missing information. You can refer to `values.schema.json` file for the structure of the `values.yaml` file.

    You can utilize a YAML schema validation extension such as [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml), or alternatively, run the following command to validate the `values.yaml` file:

    ```sh
    helm lint <chart-path>
    ```

4. After filling all the design-time information in `values.yaml`, run `cds build`. The final chart will be generated in the `gen` folder within your project directory.

5. Now to deploy the application, you can pass the runtime values in a separate `runtime-values.yaml` file and deploy the chart using the following command:

   ```sh
   helm upgrade -i -n <namespace> <release-name> <chart-path> -f <runtime-values.yaml-path>
   ```

## ❗Things to Note

* If you are adding the basic chart folder using the `cds add cap-operator` command, do not modify the `values.schema.json` file. The templates injected automatically during `cds build` are tightly coupled with the structure in `values.schema.json`. If schema changes are needed, use option `--with-templates` to add the templates folder and adjust them accordingly.

* When defining environment variables for workloads in the `values.yaml` file, it's important to mirror these definitions in the `runtime-values.yaml` file. This ensures consistency and avoids potential conflicts, as Helm does not merge arrays. If you're introducing new environment variables in `runtime-values.yaml` for a workload, remember to include existing variables from `values.yaml` to maintain coherence.
